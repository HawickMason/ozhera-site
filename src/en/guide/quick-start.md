### Kubernetes Environment Deployment
Deploying the OzHera system in a Kubernetes environment is made easy with the operator. For details, please refer to [OzHera Deployment](/zh/docs/deployment).

## 3. Application Integration
Once OzHera is deployed, the next step is to integrate specific applications for monitoring. After OzHera deployment, it comes with two pre-integrated applications.
